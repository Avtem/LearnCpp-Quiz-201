## What is this?
This is the full source code for `Quiz 201 - 15 puzzle (vanilla version)`. Vanilla means that this code doesn't have platform-specific code nor 3rd party library dependencies.\
Here we develop the code for the quiz in its entirety, until we reach a final, satisfying state.

_Notice: From step 2 onward (breaking full code into steps) this entire branch becomes obsolete because we will **construct** full code from individual modules using Code generator.exe._
